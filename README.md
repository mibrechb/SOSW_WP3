# <img src="imgs/sosw_logo.png" width="80"> SOS-Water - WP3 Earth Observation

This repository is a collection of the code contributions to the Work Package 3 - Earth Observation of SOS-Water - "Water Resources System Safe Operating Space in a Changing Climate and Society" ([DOI:10.3030/101059264](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101059264)). 

SOS-Water is a EU-funded project, started in October 2022, which aims to define a safe operating space (SOS) for the water resources, accounting concurrently for all relevant water dimensions across multiple sectors and spatial scales under the influence of socio-economic, policy, technological, and climatic changes.

This framework aims to operationalize and downscale the global freshwater SOS to the continental and river basin levels, by integrating water system models (WSMs) in five different case studies in Europe and abroad.
